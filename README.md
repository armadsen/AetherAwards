# AetherAwards

This repository contains the awards definition files shipped with [Aether](https://www.aetherlog.com/). These files are provided so that users wishing to create their own custom award definition files have examples to look at. These files can also be modified to customize awards tracking for these awards.

For a detailed description of the format Aether uses for its award definition files, see [this page](https://help.aetherlog.com/awards/customawards/).
